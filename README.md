**RAG-based Question Answering App**

This app is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based question-answering tool that leverages the Sentence Transformers model for document retrieval and Groq for generating answers. It allows users to upload a PDF file, which is then added to the app's knowledge base, enabling questions to be asked based on its content.

**Features**

**PDF Upload & Knowledge Base Update**: Upload a PDF, and the app will extract text from the document and add it to the knowledge base.

**Question Answering:** Enter a question related to the uploaded document or other knowledge in the base, and the app retrieves the most relevant document passage. It uses Groq to generate a response based on the retrieved context.

**User-Friendly Interface:** Built on Streamlit, allowing seamless interactions.
